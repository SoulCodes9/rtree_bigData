# rtree_bigData
For my final assessment, I was tasked with creating an R-Tree from scratch with 150,000 data-points and desining a search tree algorithm that finds how many data points can be found in a specific region of the tree.

My algorithm was about 130 times faster than the convenors example of an R-Tree based scan with mine having a runtime of less than 0.0001 seconds
